# Hvts3rk CTF Writeups

Collection of personal writeups. Notes taken from HackTheBox, VulnHub, ROPEmporium, etc ...

## Before Reading

The notes are written immediately and on the spot, without any post-processing activity. 

They are written in Italian and I have foreseen their translation in English in the near future.
